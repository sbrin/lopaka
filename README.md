# Lopaka — Stunning graphics for embedded screens

Lopaka is an open-source graphics editor aimed at providing an interface for creating graphics for [U8g2](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2), [AdafruitGFX](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library) and [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/).
